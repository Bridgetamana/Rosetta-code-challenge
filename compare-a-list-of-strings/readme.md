## Problem
A list is an ordered set of values that may contain duplicates. Here is an example:

const list = [['AA',  'BB', 'CC'], ['AA', 'ACB', 'AA'], [], ['AA']];
Given a list of arbitrarily many strings, implement a function for each of the following conditions:

test if they are all lexically equal
test if every string is lexically less than the one after it (i.e. whether the list is in strict ascending order)
